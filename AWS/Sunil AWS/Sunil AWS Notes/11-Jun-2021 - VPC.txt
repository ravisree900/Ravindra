VPC ctnd....
Select  Mumbai region

Step 1: Create VPC   ( MyVPC )  - 10.0.0.0/16
Step 2: Create two subnets

subnet1 - 10.0.1.0/24 - WebSN
subnet2 - 10.0.2.0/24 - DbSN

Step 3: Enable public IP to subnet1
Step 4: Create Internet Gateway  attach to VPC  -- MyIGW
Step 5: Create Route table  --  InternetRT
Step 6: Attach Route table to subnet1
Step 7: Attach Route table to Internet Gateway
Now, subnet1 is public.

++++++++++++



Now, Lets launch webserver in public subnet.
Services ---Ec2 ---- Launch instance  -- Step3  Network : MyVPC
				          Subnet: 10.0.1.0/24

Additional Details -- User Data

yum update -y
yum install httpd -y
cd /var/www/html

chkconfig httpd on

+++++++++++++++++++++


Lets Launch  Database Server in Private SUbnet.

Services ---Ec2 ---- Launch instance  -- Step3  Network : MyVPC
				          Subnet: 10.0.2.0/24

Name Tag: DbServer --  ---> Next  --  Security Group : DbSG11  , Description: DbSG11

Change Type   from SSH to MYSQL/Aurora

Type		Source		
MYSQL/Aurora	Custom		10.0.1.0/24

( MySQL Port is open to entire subnet )
Review and launch -- Launch --> Create new keypair --> (dbKP01.pem ) launch instances --- View instances

++++++++++++++++

Now, web server can pull data from database server.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++





DBA wants to create some files.  Wants to perform maintenance activity.
Can he connect?
As DB Server is not having  public IP and it is not having internect connectivity, DBA cannot connect.

For this, we need to create Bastion server/ Jump server  in public subnet
It is noting but normal EC2 Machine





Services -- EC2 -- Luanch -- Amazon Linux ---> select VPC , Select subnet

Name: BastionServer
Security Group: BastionSG01
Description: BastionSG01

(SSH  port  -- should be open to myself)
Type		Source
SSH		My IP

Review and launch -- launch -- Create new keypair  ---Bastion11.pem

View Instances

+++++++++++++++

Now, Only I can connect to Bastion server through SSH
From the Bastion server, I should able to jump into Dbserver.
That means, DbServer SSH port should be open to Bastion server.

Goto Dbserver security group  - DbSG11 ( new tab )
Select DbSG -- Inbound --Edit
Add Rule

Type		Source		
SSH		Custom		10.0.1.233/32  ( Private IP of bastion server)

Save.

Now, Lets test can we connect to DB server

In EC2 Dashboard --  select bastion server -- connect
copy user@public_ip

Open putty
Host Name - user@public_ip
Provide PPK  file -- Connect!
$  sudo su
# yum update  -y

From bastion-- we need to jump to dbserver

Now, to connect to DBserver, we need to enter the details to DBserver in Bastion server.

Select DbServer --- connect

Copy the entire ssh command.

As we are connecting from linux to linux  .pem file is enough.

Enter the ssh command in putty.
eg:
# ssh -i "DbKP7.pem" ec2-user@10.0.2.106

Note: To connect the .pem file need to be present in present working directory.

Now, we need to copy abc.pem file in bastion server.
It is there in our windows machine.

We use WINSCP to transfer the file from windows to linux

In google search for "WinSCP"
winscp.net  
download and run.

Open WINSCP
We will connet to bastion server using Winscp
host name:  user@ipaddress  
advanced ---Authentication --- private key file - select the ppk file -- open -- ok - login

Now, drag and drop the pem file  to bastion server.

In Putty
# ls   ( We should able to see the file )

Now connect to Dbserver by running the SSH command
# ssh -i "DbKP7.pem" ec2-user@10.0.2.106

You are now connected to DBserver!!!

Now, In DB server, lets execute the following commands
$ sudo su
# 

Now I want to upgrade the latest version of MYSQL database

Command to upgrade MYSQL database
# yum install mysql -y

not successfull.
We cannot install, As we are not having internet connection to private subnet.

TO get internet connection, we create NAT server. ( Network Address Translator )

The purpose of NAT is to provide internet to private subnet.
We need to create NAT in public subnet.

In VPC Dashboard
NAT Gateways --> Create NAT Gateway  ( myNAT )
subnet: 10.0.1.0/24
Create new EIP ---> Create a NAT Gateway -- Close
NAT needs 2 min appox to get created.
Name it as NAT
++++++++++++++




What is Elastic IP  ?
It is similar to public IP 
When we stop and start the EC2 Machines, public IP will change.

If you stop and start the machine, we you want the same public IP, then we create Elastic IP
Elastic IP is nothing but static public IP

Why do we need Elastic IP to NAT?
If incase NAT is down, entire private subnet will not get internet.
Then we restart the NAT again, then it acquire new public IP
When NAT acquire new public IP, there could be connection issue.
So we need Elastic IP to NAT

++++++++++++++++
NAT is a closed box. It does not have any ports concept.
So, No one can connect to NAT.

We cannot connect NAT to private Subnet.
So, we create RouteTable.
One end of RouteTable , I connect to NAT.
Another end of RouteTable, I Connect to private subnet.

Instead of creating new RouteTable, we can use default RouteTable which was created, when we created VPC

Lets change the name of default RouteTable to NatRT
Select NatRT  -- Subnet Associations -- Edit subnet Associations -- select private subnet-- save

Select NatRT  -- Routes -- Edit Routes --Add Route -- Target: NAT Gateway ( Select NAT )
Destination- 0.0.0.0/0  -- Save routes -- close

Now, lets test are we able to get internet to our DBServer.

Run the same command in putty again

# yum install mysql -y

It Works!!

Deletion process
-------------------------
Step 1: Delete NAT
Step 2: Delete EC2 Machines
Step 3: Delete VPC
Step 4: Release Elastic IPs  ( Select Elastic IP from dashboard -- Actions -- Release Address )
