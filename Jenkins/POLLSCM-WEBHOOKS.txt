poll scm and web hooks
--------------------------------
1.poll scm works based on whenever code changes and upload into 
repository automatically job builds 
2.when we give credential into the POLL SCM 
	MINUTE HOUR DOM MONTH DOW
	  *	*    *     *   *     
note:star represent repitavely
3.open job configure-->goto general-->go to build triggers-->select POLL SCM

4.Provides a cron -like feature to periodically execute this project.
This feature is primarily for using Jenkins as a cron replacement, 
and it is not ideal for continuously building software projects . 
When people first start continuous integration, they are often 
so used to the idea of regularly scheduled builds like nightly/weekly 
that they use this feature. However, the point of continuous integration 
is to start a build as soon as a change is made, to provide a quick 
feedback to the change. To do that you need to hook up SCM change 
notification to Jenkins .
------------------------------------
webhooks
-----------
1.here whenever code is modified that time only intimation will send to jenkins
  to build the job that is called web hooks
2.webhooks first configure the at the level of web repository in the git hub
3.goto github-->open one project like "maven"-->open settings-->webhooks-->add webhook-->asking credential of github
4.here display webhook information in the playLoad URL give jenkins http://jenkins_public_ip:8080/github-webhook/
	-->content type-->select json 
	-->click on add webhook
5.Now goto Jenkins web page -->goto prject -->configure-->goto general-->goto build trigger-->select Github hook trigger for GITScm polling 
	-->click on save 
6.now here my jenkins never go into check the remote repository whenever code changes in the git repository
  git will send a notification to the jenkins to build the job and based on that notification 
  jenkins trigger the CI and CD
