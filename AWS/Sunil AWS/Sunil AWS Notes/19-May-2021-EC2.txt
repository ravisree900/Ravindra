EC2  --  Elastic  compute cloud

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. 


Synonyms
Computer, machine, box, PC, Server  = As per AWS terminalogy - Instance



Ex 1: Launch windows instnace
Step 1: Login to AWS  ( sunilkumark11 )
Step 2: Choose region which is near ?  ( Asia pacific - Mumbai )
Step 3: Services --  EC2
	( If any keypairs -- delete )
	( If any security groups - delete,  except default )

	Services -- EC2 --- Launch Instance 


	Stage 1  -- Select AMI  ( Note: Select free tier eligible ) Win Server 2012
	Stage 2  --  t2.micro
	Stage 3   --  No of instances  --  1
	Stage 4  --  Storage - 30GB ( Observation - we have root - it is same as C Drive)

	Stage 5  --  Add Tag --  Giving name to the machine 
			Add Name Tag
			Value - MyWindows
	Stage 6  -- Security group  --  ( It deals with ports )
			We have 0 to 65535  ports
			Every port is dedicated to special purpose

			RDP -- 3389
			SSH -- 22
			HTTP -- 80
			HTTPS - 443
			
			For windows machine , we need to open RDP port  ( Remote Desktop Protocol )
			He by default , we have RDP
			
	Stage 7		Just observe the warnings, Just verify the options, Launch


Create a new keypair--  download key pair -- launch instance

We get the instance ID  i-0dddc6c37c9dfb460
			View Instances



Now, the new windows machines ,is having its own DNS Name, Username and password


We need to provide all the above 3 details in our laptop, so that we can connect.

We use an application called Remote Desktop Connection


AWS , gives us  DNS name , username, it does not give the password.
	Instead of password , AWS has given us pem file.
	But, to connect to Window, we need password

	AWS gives an option to convert .pem to password

How to connect .pem to password
---------------------------------
Connect to instance Get password -- upload pem file -- Decrypt  



Open Remote Desktop
Computer - Provide DNS
User name  --  Administrator
password  -- c&$*LjvfdL


Hurray!!
We are connected.


Lets check the hardware configuration
CHeck hard disk
Check Ram
You can copy paste file from laptop to win server  !!

To disconnect, just close the remote desktop window.
Explain about  Stop and reboot and terminate
