Database Module
--------------------------
1) RDS   - SQL

----------------
SQL ( Structued Query language )
RDS  ( Relational Database Service )

Two type of backups
----------------------------
1) Manual ( DB Snapshots )
2) Automated

We take the backup, in the form of snapshot.
If database is lost, we restore snapshot as database.
We will have downtime, in this case.

===========
Everyday AWS will take the full backup of database automatically.
Backup is maintained for the last 35 days ( Rentention Period )
Default retention period is 7 Days
AWS will take incremental backup in every 1 min.

Incremental backup are called transactional logs.

If we intentionally delete the database, backup will also be deleted.

Manual backups are user initiated.
Even if you delete the database intentionally, we will have manual backups.

How can we eliminate the downtime
-------------------------------------------------
By using multi availability zone.

Read Replicas
---------------------
To protect from load.

SQS ( Simple Queue Service) - Theory
-------------------------------------------


		Route 53  (  www.sunilcloud.com )




		LB



	Ws1          Ws2                    Ws3


                                    SQS


		AS1		AS2

		DB

The backup mechanism for Application server is SQS

All the requests from webservers will be stored in SQS in Queue format.
Application server will pull the requests from SQS.
SQS will control the flow of the requests.


Once the request is pulled from the SQS, the request in SQS will not be deleted. It will be invisible for 30 sec

Within 30 sec APplication server should process the request.
Within 30 sec, if Application server process the request, it will be deleted from SQS.


Within 30 sec, if Application server unable process the request, it will be visible again in SQS.

If Application server takes more than 30 sec?
We can increase the visibility time out upto  12 hrs

By default SQS will maintain the request for 4 days.

We can set maximum request to 14 days

SNS ( Simple notification service )
-----------------------------------
When auto scaling launches new machine, we need notification.
In route53, failover routing policy, one region is down, we need notification.

We can receive the noficiation by using SNS

Subscribers --  Are nothing but users.


Step 1: We create a group  ( It is also called topic )
We add email address of subscribers into the group.

The process of adding subscribers to the group, is called subscription.

Notifications we can receive through
1) Email  with normal text.
2) Email with JSON Script
3)Mobile SMS
4) Http / https requests

Practicals
-----------------
Services -- Application Integration - Simple notification service.

Create topic - MyTopic1 -- Next Step --Create topic

Scroll down
Click on Create subscription 
Protocol - Email
Endpoint - sunildevops77@gmail.com
Create Subscription
Observation:  Status as pending confirmation.

When the status is confirmed?
We need to login to email and accept the email.
We will get email with subject - AWS Notification - Subscription COnfirmation.
Confirm the subscription.

Now, goto SNS and refresh
Observation: Status as confirmed.

Now, lets test the SNS with respect to Autoscaling

InEC2 dashboard -- select launch configuration -- Create launch configuration -- Next --
Name - MyLC -- Next -- Next --Review -- Create launch configuration.

Create an auto scaling group using this launch configuration.
Group Name - MyASG  
Subnet - 1b -- next -- Next -- 
Step 3: Add notification

send a notification to -  My AWS ( we can see our topic name )
( We get notification whenever we launch, terminate, fail to launch, fail to terminate )

( Lets  say, I want to add another email.
Go to subscriptions -- Create subscriptions --  Select existing topic  -- Protocal : Email

Endpoint - Enter new email  )
+++++++++
cancel autoscaling group, delete launch configuration.
Select the subscription -- Delete
Select the topic -- delete
