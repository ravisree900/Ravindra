VPC ctnd....
Select  Mumbai region

Step 1: Create VPC   ( MyVPC )  - 10.0.0.0/16
Step 2: Create two subnets

subnet1 - 10.0.1.0/24  -- WebSN
subnet1 - 10.0.2.0/24  --DbSN

Step 3: Enable public IP to subnet1
Step 4: Create Internet Gateway  attach to VPC  -- MyIGW
Step 5: Create Route table  - InternetRT
Step 6: Attach Route table to subnet1
Step 7: Attach Route table to Internet Gateway
Now, subnet1 is public.
Step 8: Create NAT in public subnet
	So that we can have internet to private subnet

NAT Gateways --> Create NAT Gateway
subnet: 10.0.1.0/24
Create new EIP ---> Create a NAT Gateway -- Close
NAT needs 2 min appox to get created.

++++++++++++++
We need another Route table.
Instead of creating new Route table, lets use existing default route table which was created automatically when VPC was created.

We will use this route table to connect to NAT Gateway
Lets Edit the name - NatRT

One end of NatRT, we will connect to private subnet.

Select NatRT ---Subnet Associations -- Edit Subnet Associations -- select private subnet ( 10.0.2.0/24 ) -- save

Another end of NatRT , we will connect to NAT

Select NatRT -- Routes ---> Edit Routes-- Add Route 
Target -- NAT Gateway ( Select the Nat Gateway )
Destination - 0.0.0.0/0  ( Mandatory )

Save Routes -- Close

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now, Lets launch Ec2 machine in public subnet.
Name: Webserver
Security Group:   WebSg11
Description: WebSg1

SSH  port  -- should be open to myself
HTTP port -- should be open to all.

Type		Source	
SSH		My IP
HTTP		Anywhere

Review and launch -- Create new keypar  --  WebServer11KP.pem  --> Launch instances -- View instances

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



Creating   Bastion/ Jump server  in public subnet
DBA wants to connect to db server, to perform some maintenance activity.
How can he connect? For this we create  Bastion Server.


For Bastion server 

SSH  port  -- should be open to myself

Bastion server is nothing but EC2 Machine

Services -- EC2 -- Luanch -- Amazon Linux ---> select VPC , Select subnet

Name: BastionServer
Security Group: Bastion11SG
Description: Bastion11SG

Type		Source
SSH		My IP

Review and launch -- launch -- Create new keypair  ---BastionServer11.pem

View Instances

Now, Only I can connect to Bastion server through SSH
 Only I can connect to Web server through SSH

Anyone in the world can access webserver ( Check with IP Address )

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Create one database server in private subnet.
Name Tag: DbServer

Security group: Db11Sg
Description: Db11Sg
	
Type			Source			
MYSQL/Aurora		Custom		10.0.1.0/24
SSH 			Custom		10.0.1.110/32   ( Bastion server private IP )

Review and launch --download keypair --  db11KP.pem  -- launch insances

Network ACL ( NACL )
----------------------------
Security group will provide security at instance level
NACL will provide security at subnet level.

Creating  NACL
------------------------
Select Network ACL ---- We have two default NACL
One for default VPC
One for MyVPC
( So, whenever we create new VPC, by default  NACL is created automatically )

We will create a new NACL and attach to public subnet
----------------------------------------------------------------
Create Network ACL -- Name Tag: PublicNACL
VPC: MyVPC
Create
Subnet Associations -- Edit subnet associations --select public subnet
Edit

------------
Now, try to access the webser
We cannot get the webpage !!! No


We need to open ports at NACL
Inbound rules ---- Edit inbound rules --Add rule

Rule#	Type		Source
100 	SSH		122.175.5.152/32  ( My laptop IP,we can get it from bastion security group ) 
200	HTTP		0.0.0.0/0			( HTTP open to all )

Save.





Now, try to access the webser
We cannot get the webpage !!!  No

We need to know about statefull and stateless
---------------------------------------
Lets select  webSecurity group  -- Inbound tab  -- edit

Did we add ports in outbound tab?

In security group, when we open inbound port, by default outbound port is open to all.
This status is called statefull.

So, we have opened HTTP incoming, by default outbound port is open to all.
Hence, we are able to access webserver.

This status is called statefull.


For NACL , The case is different.
We need to open outbound port  to NACL explicitly.
So, NACL is stateless






Select NACL -- Outbound Rules --- Edit Outbound Rules --- Add Rule 

Rule		Type		Destination	
100		SSH		122.175.5.152/32  ( MY IP )
200 		HTTP		0.0.0.0/0

Save

Now, can we able to access webserver
No!!!


Ephemeral ports
-----------------------
Total Range of ports :  0 to 65535
Range  1024 - 65535  are the range of ephemeral ports

search in google "ephemeral ports in AWS" , we can see the range

Assume in public subnet, we have 100 webservers
All are connected to load balancer.
If hacker blocks any http port on 1 webserver
Will it be a problem?
No!! 
As load balancer will send the request to other servers.

If hacker blocks any http port on NACL level  ( sunbnet level )
Entire website is down.

To avoid this problem, AWS is providing range of ports  ( 1024 - 65535 )

We need to open this range in NACL level,
So when hacker blocks a particular port ( HTTP ),  AWS uses a random port from the range.
AWS will replace  the  random as HTTP port.

So that website will never godown.




Note:  Ephemeral ports are mandatory at NACL level
++++++++++++++++++
Select --  PublicNACL --- Inbound  -- Edit inboud rules -- Add rule

Rule	Type			port range
300	Custom TCP Rule 		1024-65535

Save.

Now, can we able to access webserver?
No!!

NACL are stateless. We need to open ports  in outbound level also.

Select --  PublicNACL --- Outbound  -- Edit outboud rules -- Add rule

Rule	Type			port range
300	Custom TCP Rule 		1024-65535

Save.

++++++++++++++++++
Now, can we able to access webserver?
Yes!!

++++++++++++++++++++
WHat is the use of NACL?

Select our NACL -- inbound rules

Rule	Type
200	HTTP    we have opened to all.

Add Rule	
Rule#	Type		Allow/ Deny
201	HTTP		Deny

Save.


Similarly

Select our NACL -- outbound rules

Rule	Type
200	HTTP    we have opened to all.

Add Rule	Type		Allow/ Deny
201	HTTP		Deny

Save.

Now,  Are we able to access webserver?
Yes!!!
Conclusion, Lowest rule#  will have highest priority.


Now, in inbound rules
Rule# --  201  change to  199.
Save.

goto outboud rules
Rule# --  201  change to  199.
Save.

Now, 	 Lowest rule#  is 199  which is deny.
so, we cannot access the webserver.
No!!

Usecase:
-------------
Hacker is continuous accessing the webserver.
We want to block his IP, but other customers should be able to access the webserver.

How can we do it.
Lets Assume, I am the hacker
Now, in inbound rules , change the source

Rule#			Source
199			122.175.5.152/32    ( My laptop  IP  )

Save.

 ( Network team will give us incoming request IP address)

Similarly in outboud rules also

Rule#			Source
199			106.217.195.229/32    ( My laptop  IP  )

Save.

Now, Are we able to access webserver  
No! ( As it is blocked to my machine )

But, others can able to access the webserver.

Imp Usecase:  By using NACL, we can block  specific IP address

Now,
Lets delete Rule# 199  from inbound and outbound level.
Save.

Now, Are we able to access webserver  
Yes!!!

NACL is not recommended to use for private subnet.

Deletion process
-------------------
Step 1: Delete NAT
Step 2: Delete all Ec2 Machines
Step 3: Delete VPC
Step 4: Release Elastic IP
