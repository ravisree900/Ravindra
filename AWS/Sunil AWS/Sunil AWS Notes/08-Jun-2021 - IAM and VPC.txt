AWS CLI  ( Command line Interface )
------------------------------------------------

To connect from CLI, We need to provide  Access Keys and secret key.

Observation, in IAM dashboard,  root access keys are deleted!!!


Generation of root access keys
-----------------------------------------
Select "Delete your root access keys"  ---> Manage security credentials ---> Continue to security credentials---> 
Access keys ( access key ID  and secret access key ) --  create new access key ---> Show access key.
Download the key file ---> Close

Access Key ID:
AKIAJ5UQIJEMYYTB4QNA
Secret Access Key:
y33k+6K2Ov2j5K7FEhDNCHCMvGKOGLwixlrRFSOa




Now, goto dashboard   , "Delete your root access keys"  is not tick.

As keys are ready, we can access to AWS from CLI

We need to download and install AWS CLI tool.

Search "Aws cli tool for windows"  in google
select the 1st link ( docs.amazon.com )

select  " Download the AWS CLI MSI installer for windows 64 bit"
download and run the file.
Once the CLI is intalled, we can see it in control panel -- uninstall program 
We can see "AWS Command line interface" ( Just observation )

+++++++++=
Open command prompt

> aws configure
AWS access key ID  [*****]:    enter access key ID from file downloaded 
AWS secret Access key [***  ]: enter secret key ID from file downloaded  
Default region name :ap-south-1


Note: ap-south-1  ( Is nothing but region name of mumbai.
		We can get this information from google ) 
Default region is north virginia

Default output format : text

We get the prompt. ( We have logged in )
>  

+++++++++++++++++++++++
From the console,  create 2 buckets.

We can see the list of buckets from command line

search in google " aws s3 commands"
( Note: we do not need to remember commands )
under available commands
select ls  ( open in new window )

under Examples
aws s3 ls

Run the command
We can see the buckets!!!

++++++++++++++
under available commands
select mb  ( open in new window )  (mb - make bucket )

Under Examples
aws s3 mb s3://mybucket         ( mybucker is the name )

Run the command  

We can see the new bucket in console!!!

+++++++++++++++++++
I want to upload the file to the bucket

under available commands
select cp  ( open in new window )  (mb - make bucket )

copying the local file to S3
aws s3 cp test.txt   s3://mybucket7654376

( test.txt should be available in current path )

We can see the file available in the bucket in console.

++++++++++++++++++
Creating user from command line
--------------------------------
Search in google " aws iam commands"

Available commands
click on create-user
Under Examples
To create an IAM  user

> aws iam create-user --user-name hari

copy and paste

Now, user is created from the command line.
We can also check from console.

++++++++++

We have 1000's of commands in AWS
Most of the opearations we can also do it from CLI

We do not need to remember the commands

We have experienced AWS CLI from windows machine.

Lets learn how can we work with AWS CLI  on linux?

Lets create a new EC2 machine of linux

Services --->EC2 --> Amazon linux --Next --> Next
Security group  ( open SSH and HTTP ) -- review and launch-> Launch.

Connect to machine using putty



Now, we need to install AWS CLI  tool on linux
Note:  All EC2 machine comes with AWS CLI installed on it.

so, we do need to install AWS CLI on the machine, which we have created.

$  sudo su 
# yum update -y
#  aws configure

AWS access key ID  [*****]:    enter access key ID from file downloaded 
AWS secret Access key [***  ]: enter secret key ID from file downloaded  
Default region name :ap-south-1


Note: ap-south-1  

Default output format :   just hit enter

#

Lets create group
--------------------
# aws iam create-group  --group-name  devops

Lets create user

# aws iam create-user --user-name raj

( We can verify users and group from console )
