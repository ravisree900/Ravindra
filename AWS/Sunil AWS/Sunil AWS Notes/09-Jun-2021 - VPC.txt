We will create a private cloud and assign ip range  10.0.0.0/16

  32
- 16
---------
   16

  2 power 16  = 65536 ( ip address )

So, in our private cloud we can have only 65536 machines only.

++++++++++++
We have different types of servers
1) Web servers
2) Application server
3) database servers


We cannot dump all the servers directly.

Web server -  We want everyone in the world to access web server.
Always request  will be sent to web server.  
From the webserver , request will be sent to database server.



User request, should not sent to database directly.

So, we will be creating two subnets
one subnet for webserver
one subnet for database server.

For one subnet, I provide range  10.0.1.0/24
For 2nd subnet, I provide range  10.0.2.0/24

By default, subnet are private.
I want to make one  subnet as public.

As, we want to make webserver as public  

Practicals
-------------------
Select Mumbai Region.
Step 1: Create VPC  ( 10.0.0.0/16 )

Services ---> Network and content delivery --> VPC

We have some default VPC, Default subnet, Default Route tables.

Your VPC ----> Create VPC --> 
Name Tag             - MyVPC
IPV4 CIDR Block  - 10.0.0.0/16
( Note : Our VPC can have maximum 2 power 16 machines )
Create --> Close


Step 2:   	
Inside VPC, we are creating 1st  subnets.
In dashboard ---> Subnets ---> Create subnet 
Name Tag -  ( We will discuss later )
VPC  -- MYVPC  ( Select our subnet )
Availability Zone -- ap-southeast-1a  ( Select any zone )
IPV4 CIDR Block - 10.0.1.0/24
Name Tag - 10.0.1.0/24 - ap-southeast-1a  (  IPV4  -  availability is the naming convention )
Create ---> Close


Step 3:   	
Inside VPC, we are creating 2nd  subnets.
In dashboard ---> Subnets ---> Create subnet 
Name Tag -  ( We will discuss later )
VPC  -- MYVPC  ( Select our subnet )
Availability Zone -- ap-southeast-1b  ( Select different zone /any zone )
IPV4 CIDR Block - 10.0.2.0/24
Name Tag - 10.0.2.0/24 - ap-southeast-1b  (  IPV4  -  availability is the naming convention )
Create ---> Close
