Practicals
------------

Services ----> Networking and content delivery ---> Route 53

Step 1: We need to buy a domain name.

Register domain
hello.com   ( unavailable )

sunil-test-t.com  -- Add to cart -- Continue  

Once you buy the domain,
We the see the domain in dashboard -- Registered domain.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Lets make the setup ready

Select London region , create two webservers and attach to load balancer.
Select Sydney region , create one webservers and attach to load balancer.

-----------
	
Select london region ---- Ec2 -- Launch instance
Amazon linux --- Next -- no of instance 1   - advanced Details

#!/bin/bash
sudo su
yum update -y
yum install httpd -y
cd /var/www/html
echo "London-1" > index.html
service httpd start
chkconfig httpd on


Next -- Next -- Name tag - London-1 --Security group-- 
Create new Group  - MyWebSG9
 ( open SSH and HTTP )
Review and launch -- new key pair - mylondon9.pem  -- launch.

Similary , lets launch another webserver.

Amazon linux --- Next -- no of instance 1   - advanced Details

#!/bin/bash
sudo su
yum update -y
yum install httpd -y
cd /var/www/html
echo "London-2" > index.html
service httpd start
chkconfig httpd on


Next -- Next -- Name tag - London-2 --Security group -- Select existing 
Group Name - MyWebSG9  (  SSH and HTTP )
Review and launch -- choose existing key pair - mylondon10.pem  -- launch.
View instances.

--------
Create load balancer -- Classic load balancer 

Load Balancer Name: London-LB ----Next -- Select existing security group - MyWebSG9 --Next
Response Timeout  - 2
Interval - 5
Unhealth threshold - 2
Healthy Threshold - 2
Next -- add EC2 -- Select both the instance -- Review -- create -- close

==========




Lets Switch to Sydney region 
Instances -- launch instance --  Amazon linux --- Next -- Step 3: Advanced Details


#!/bin/bash
sudo su
yum update -y
yum install httpd -y
cd /var/www/html
echo "Sydney1" > index.html
service httpd start
chkconfig httpd on


NExt -- Next -- Name Tag:  Sydney-1  -- Next -- New Security group : SydSG9
					Description: SydSG9

Type		Source
SSH		Anywhere
HTTP		Anywhere

Review and launch -- launch - New key pair: mysydney9.pem ---  download -- launch

-----------
Create load balancer ---CLassic -- Load balancer Name: Syd-LB  -- 
Next -- select existing security group ( SydSG9 ) -- Next -- Step 4: Configure health check

Response Timeout  - 2
Interval - 5
Unhealth threshold - 2
Healthy Threshold - 2
Next -- add EC2 -- Select the instance -- Review -- create -- close


Testing the load balancer
---------------------------
Select London load balancer -- DNS name
try from browser  ( Works!!! )

Sydney Load balancer -- will also works  ( you may need to wait for 2 min )


-------------------------------
When we buy the domain, we get hosted zones
Both information we have in the dashboard.

Select the hosted zone  (  sunilcloud.com ) , we get two records

NS --  stands for name server.
SOA -  stands for start of authority

We need to create a new record set - Alias Record

Create record set -- Name:  www   ( just type www in the text box  )

Alias  - select  yes ( radio button )

Alias Target -  Select London Load balancer DNS NAme.

Routing policy  - Simple   
create.

=========
Now, test the domain  ( sunilcloud.com ) in browser
It Works!!!

We have achieved 1st advantage.
Instead of providing difficult Load Balancer DNS name to public, we have provided user friendly domain name.

+++++++++++++++++

Weighted - routing policy

Lets delete the record set.

Create record set --- Name: www 

Alias  - select  yes ( radio button )

Alias Target -  Select London Load balancer DNS NAme

Routing policy  - Weighted
Weight : 70
Set ID :  London LB  ( It is just description )

Create.

Create another record set
---------------------------------------

Create record set --- Name: www 

Alias  - select  yes ( radio button )

Alias Target -  Select Sydney Load balancer DNS NAme

Routing policy  - Weighted
Weight : 30
Set ID :  Sydney LB  ( It is just description )

Create.

Test!!!!
Try to access domain from different IP  address ( machine )  to get the ration.

++++++++++++++++++++
Latency - routing policy

Lets delete the two record sets , which we have created.

Create record set --- Name: www 

Alias  - select  yes ( radio button )

Alias Target -  Select London Load balancer DNS NAme

Routing policy  - Latency
Region -  eu-west-2    ( Official Region of London. We get it from DNS name also )

RecordID :  London LB  ( It is just description )

Create.


Create another record set
---------------------------------------

Create record set --- Name: www 

Alias  - select  yes ( radio button )

Alias Target -  Select Sydney Load balancer DNS NAme

Routing policy  - Latency
Region -  ap-southeast-2    ( Official Region of sydney. We get it from DNS name also )
Set ID :  Sydney LB  ( It is just description )

Create.

Test!!!!
We get london page, As london is near to us
If a user from Aus try to access domain, we get Sydney page.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Failover policy

Lets delete the two record sets.

Lets make london and primary region
Sydney as secondary region.

We need to create health checks for this policy.
Dashboard --- health checks --  create health check -- Name: London-HC

specify endpoint - Domain name

Domain name - provide DNS name of london load balancer
path - index.html  ( Route 53 will check the entry of the file index.html in LB)

Advanced configuration
Request Interval - Fast ( 10 Sec )      ( waiting for to get ping response )
Failure threshold - 1

Next ---  Create health check.

---------
Go to hosted zones -- select the domain -- create record set

Create record set --- Name: www 

Alias  - select  yes ( radio button )

Alias Target -  Select London Load balancer DNS NAme

Routing policy  - Failover
Failover record type - primary
Evaluate target Health - yes
Associate health check - yes
Health check to Associate  - London-HC

Create.

--------
Create another record set
---------------------------------------

Create record set --- Name: www 

Alias  - select  yes ( radio button )

Alias Target -  Select Sydney Load balancer DNS NAme

Routing policy  - Failover
Failover record type - Secondary
Evaluate target Health - no
Associate health check - no

Create.

test!!!
We get london page,  as it is primary.
Lets simulate failure scenario

Lets stop both the Ec2 machines in london region.
Now , access the domain, we should get sydney page.
Lets  start the Ec2 machines,  we should get london page.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Geolocation Policy
--------------------------
Look at the Typical requirement
Traffic from london should to routed to london.
Traffic from india should be routed to sydney.

Lets delete the two record sets.
Delete health check.

Go to hosted zones -- select the domain -- create record set

Create record set --- Name: www 

Alias  - select  yes ( radio button )

Alias Target -  Select London Load balancer DNS NAme

Routing policy  - Geolocation
Location - United Kingdom   ( Location of the customers )
Set ID - LondonLB
Create.
--------------
Create another record set --- Name: www 

Alias  - select  yes ( radio button )

Alias Target -  Select Sydney Load balancer DNS NAme

Routing policy  - Geolocation
Location - india  ( Location of the customers )
Set ID - SydneyLB
Create.

test!!!
We get sydney page  ( As traffic from india )
traffic from london , we get london page.

Requirement
---------------------


Traffic from india should be routed to sydney.
Except india, traffic from other countries should be routed to london.

For this, in the first record set
Location - default.

++++++++++++++
Deletion process
--------------------
Delete two record sets.
Delete health check if any.
Terminate EC2 machines of both the regions.
Delete Load balancers in both the regions.
