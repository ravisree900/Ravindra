CloudWatch ( monitoring Service )
----------------------------
Step 1: Create two EC2 machines.
	Name it as i) Machine 1
                   ii) Machine 2


Monitoring tab, helps you get the cloudWatch metrics like
1) CPU Utilization
2) Disk read ( Bytes )
3) Disk write ( Bytes )
4) Network packets in
5) Network packets out etc

These metrics will be updated every 5 min.

What is detailed monitoring?
we get the metrics for every one min. ( Its paid service )

++++++++++++++++++++
Lets go to cloudwatch dashboard.

Services --  Managment and Governance -- CloudWatch
Select Metrics ---  EC2 
We can see all the metrics available.

Select the required Machine and metrics, so that we can monitor.

+++++++++++++++++++++++
Setting up an Alarm, to take the action.


Topic Name - TEST_TOPIC
Alarm Name - My_alarm2

+++++++++++++++++++++++++
How to set billing Alarm?

Goto My Account --  Billing Preferences --  Select receive billing Alerts.


In the navigation pane, choose Alarms, Create Alarm.

Choose Select metric. In the All metrics tab, choose Billing, Total Estimated Charge.

Select the check box next to EstimatedCharges, and choose Select metric.

Under Conditions, choose Static.

For Whenever EstimatedCharges is, choose Greater.

For than, enter the monetary amount (for example, 10) that must be exceeded to trigger the alarm.

+++++++++++++++
Deletion process
---------------------
1) Delete Alarm
2) Terminate EC2 Machine.

---------------------------------


Cloud Trail
------------------
Its an auditing service.



In IAM , we have learnt how to create users, groups, assign users to groups etc.

Lets Say, someone has deleted S3 bucket?
How to know, which users has done this? 
At what time, it has happened?
We can track this information using cloud trail.
All the activites can be tracked by user using cloud trail.

Services -- CloudTrail
Select event history

Observation: We can see the records of the events which we have performed.

Select a particular event, we can get more  detail information.

We can apply filters
Filter : Resource type      Bucket
We can see the events related to the Se Bucket

We can apply filter based on time period.
We can download the list of events.

Note: Root user can see the Event history.
IAM users will not have access to see the event history.

Cloud Formation
---------------------------
3 Ways to create AWS Infrastructure
1) GUI 
2) CLI
3) IAC ( Infrastructure as Code )

COde is written in JSON/Yaml script
When we run the code infrastructure will be created.

Adavnatages
------------------------
We can store the code in S3 for repeated execution
We can have version controlling

Practicals
-----------------
Services -- Management and Governanace -- CloudFormation
Create Stack -- Create Template in designer
Select Templates tab  ( Select YAML radio button )
Under Resource Types - select EC2 --- Ec2Fleet  -- Drag and drop in the right side frame.
We get the YAML code

-------------
Lets goback and select sample template
Select LAMP  Stack ---  ( select view in designer to see the code - new tab )
Next -- Stack Name - MyStack 
            DB Password - welcome
            DBRootPassword - welcome
            DBUsername - welcome
          Keyname - cf

Next --- Tags   --  Name: LAMP Stack --- Next --- Create Stack

( We shoule able to see Webserver, security group.
In Webserver  , PHP and MySQL will be installed )

-----------
Goto Services -- Ec2  , We can see one EC2 machine gets created.
Goto security group -  One Security Group is also created.

---------------
In stack details dashboard -- outputs
We get website URL  ( This is noting but DNS name to the EC2 Machine )
Open the URL
We get the default website.

===================



What is terraform?
It is similar for CloudFormation.
By using terraform, we can create AWS / Azure / GCP Infrastructure.
It used "hcl" language

------------------
Deletion process
-------------------
Delete the stack, complete infrastructure gets deleted.
( EC2 Machine is terminated, Security group is also deleted )

+++++++++++++++
Elastic BeanStalk
Mainly used by developers
Developers write the code for creating application.
For testing the code, developers needs Machine ( Ec2 instance )

Developers are not inclined/ preffered to create infrastructure.
The solution for developers is ElasticBeanStalk.

Developers write the code, they upload the code into ElasticBeanStalk.
Infrastucture will be created automatically for testing the application.

Objective of CloudFormation is to create Infrastructure
Objective to ElasticBeanStalk is to test the application


Practicals
-----------------
Services -- compute --  Elastic Beanstalk
Get started  
Application Name - MyApp
Platform - PHP

Select Sample Application

Create Application ( It will take few min ) Hit refresh in Ec2 dashboard.
 Ec2 machine is created, code will be deployed into the Ec2 Machine.
Observation: Security group will also be created with the Application Name.


How we can see the website,
in MyApp dashboard -- We get environment ID and Application URL

++++++++++++
Deleting the Application
In All Applications 
Actions -- Delete Application.	
Automatically   EC2 and Security groups will be deleted.

Snowball
----------------
It is a data migration service.

Lets Say, you have 1 TB of data.
You need to migrate 1 TB data to S3 bucket.
Assume, it takes 1 hr time to migrate.

If the data is 100 TB?
If the data is 1000 TB ( 1 zeta byte )
If the data is 100 ZB?
If the data is 1000 ZB? ( 1 peta byte )
If the data in 100 PB  - It takes years to load the data.

Ex: Facebook, will have huge amount of data
The solution is snowball
There are three variants in snowball
1) snowball
2) snowball edge
3) snow mobile



1) snowball
---------------
Its a physical hard disk, AWS will send to the clients location.
The size of the snowball will be 80 TB

Search in google "aws snowball"  we can see the image of the snowball.

2) snowball edge
--------------------------
The size is 100 TB
Snowball edge contains compute capacity.
It comes with display ( similar to mobile phone )
We can edit , delete  from the display.

Usecase: National Geographic Channel  
will take snowball edge to forest shoots  etc

Search in google "aws snowball edge"


3) snow mobile
--------------------------
The size is 100 PB
Its like truck.
Search in google "aws snowball mobile"
