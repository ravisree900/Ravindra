A load balancer accepts incoming traffic from clients and routes requests to EC2 instances 
( Targets). 
The load balancer also monitors the health of its registered targets and ensures that it routes traffic only to healthy targets. 
When the load balancer detects an unhealthy target, it stops routing traffic to that target. It then resumes routing traffic to that target when it detects that the target is healthy again.






Step 1: Create Linux Machine
Launch instance ---  Amazon Linux -- No of intances - 1 --- Name Tag- Lin-1 --- Security Group - LinSG
Description - LinSG
Add Rule
HTTP

Launch 

---------- 


Step 2: COnvert pem to ppk file


Step 3:  Access the machine

Step 4: Run the commands to install web package
sudo su
 yum update -y
 yum install httpd -y
cd    /var/www/html
echo "MyGoogle-1" > index.html
ls
service httpd start
chkconfig httpd on




Step 5: Access the webserver by using public_ip



Step 6: Launch one more Linux Machine and install Web package
AmazonLinux -- Step 3: Advanced Details - User data 

#!/bin/bash
sudo su
yum update -y
yum install httpd -y
cd /var/www/html
echo "MyGoogle-2" > index.html
service httpd start
chkconfig httpd on


Next -- Add Name Tag -- Step 6: Select existing security group -- Choose existing key pair -- Launch instance.



Step 7: Create load balancers
Select classic load balancer

Load Balancer Name - MyLB --> Next ----> select existing security group ---> NExt -- Step 4: 

Response Timeout - 2 Seconds
Interval - 5 Seconds
Unhealthy threshold - 2 
Healthy threshold - 2 

Next --  Attach both the instances
Next -- Next --Create




Step 8: Lest verify the 2nd instance manually
Select public ip and paste in browser

Step 9: Access the load balance by using DNS   
and experience the load balancer.

Step 10:  If one server is down, it should redirect the traffic to another server.

1) we can stop/terminate the machine
2) remove the file / rename the file

Lets remove index.html file in server1

Go to putty
ls  ( To see the list of files )

# rm index.html

Now, access the load balance  , traffic should be redirected to 2nd server.


How can we know, which instance is down?
Goto load balances ---> instances tab,
We can see the status is OutOfService.

+++++++
Lets re create index.html file

# echo  "Google-1" > index.html

+++++++++++

Now load balance will start sending the traffic to server1

++++++
To avoid billing ----> remove both the instance  ----> delete load balances
